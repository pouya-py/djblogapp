<h5>django blog app</h5>
<p>in this project i created a blog app that users can share their thoughts and also comment on the other articles or posts.
also i used built-in django authentication system and i used sql3 database which it is not used in production but just in case you can change it to postgresql or ant database that django supports.</p>
